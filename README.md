# Abhya

## 1-Requirements analysis:

### Raspberry Pi Camera

 Raspberry Pi Cameras will have our software installed based on the deep learning model.


### Police Station

The website opened on their system. Their system should receive live feed of the nearby cameras connected in the area All the contact numbers of various emergency departments stored in their system

## 2-Overview:

Gone are the days when you would fear to go out alone at night. Abhaya provides a unique solution which entirely transforms the whole situation. Now one can go out fearlessly wherever and whenever they want.

In recent years, there have been many cases of violence against women which could have been prevented if the authorities would have detected it earlier and had taken proper action. This web app helps the Police to streamline their way of work and work effectively towards women safety which is a major issue in our country.

Our web application will help to detect violence, and as soon as the violence is detected, the application will send an alert to the nearby police station. The police can further decide if the situation needs an emergency action as well as what other departments to communicate with .We also have an option to ignore the alert if thereâ€™s some misunderstanding and it is not actually a case of violence.

The CCTV camera

The CCTV camera will have an ML model running which will detect if there are any incidents of violence or potential risks of crimes which might follow after violence. CCTV cameras in a particular area will be connected to the local police station .These CCTV cameras will send alerts and notifications to the police station ,which will then respond accordingly.

## Police station

The user at the police station will be able to receive notifications and alerts and can take the necessary action to prevent the breaking out of violence, contact different departments to handle the situation effectively in case the violence has taken place or to take emergency steps as and when required with the help of real-time detection of violence.

Departments which the police can call

Nearest Hospital for Ambulance
NHAI (National Highway Authority of India)
Forensics
Women helpline department
## 3-Tech stack:

* Tensorflow
* Keras
* Flask
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap

## 4-Deliverables:

This will provide us with a faster interface of reporting to the police station and hence prevent any delay in taking action as the officer incharge would be immediately notified. Sometimes these cases may go unreported, our project will ensure that this will never happen again. We also have an Emergency Button which immediately notifies all the listed departments (listed in overview section) so our response time is even faster.

## 5-Future Aspects:

It will also notify the Taxi/Bus drivers and the Patrol Police cars in the radius of 1km around the location of the detected incident. They will get a notification in their application about the incident along with the location of the incident. Then they can respond accordingly We will need their position to find if they are in a 1km radius. We can also provide the user authentication for different police stations so that the application would work with respect to the location of the police station. It would give more priority to the incident alerts happening near to that particular location. The application can also detect types of violence happening and can provide suggestions to the police officer which emergency departments to contact.

## 6-Mockups

1. This is the main page of the website. It shows different camera views and gives an alert if any violence is detected. It also has an option to overview the application and guide on how to use it.

2. This is the page which pops up if the person clicks on the video which gives the alert. The person will receive the location and video and he can choose whether to respond or ignore. The emergency button directs to the next page.

3. This page opens up if the person clicks the emergency button. He/she will get an option to go and take the action himself or call any of the emergency services like ambulance, forensics,etc.

4. This page gives an overview of the product like the prerequisites needed, the future aspects, etc.

5. This page is a user guide. It explains in detail how to use the website.
