#### About the Product
Gone are the days when you would fear to go out alone at night. Abhaya provides a unique solution which entirely transforms the whole situation. Now one can go out fearlessly wherever and whenever they want.

In recent years, there have been many cases of violence against women which could have been prevented if the authorities would have detected it earlier and had taken proper action. This web app helps the Police to streamline their way of work and work effectively towards women safety which is a major issue in our country.

Our web application will help to detect violence, and as soon as the violence is detected, the application will send an alert to the nearby police station. The police can further decide if the situation needs an emergency action as well as what other departments to communicate with .We also have an option to ignore the alert if thereâ€™s some misunderstanding and it is not actually a case of violence.

#### Novelty of the Project
Unlike most of the surveillance systems which use CCTV cameras to get recordings of activities in an area, our project used the module of Rpi as a hidden camera due to the advantage of its small size to send live alerts using the ML model. The ML model detects the voilence as well as the percentage of voilence.
